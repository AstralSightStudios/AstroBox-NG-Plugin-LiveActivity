AstroBox-NG Non-Commercial Community Source License
Version 1.3

Copyright (c) 2025 AstralSightStudios

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.


0. Preamble

This License governs the software project known as “AstroBox-NG” and all
repositories, modules, components, and related works that:

  (1) are maintained under the “AstralSightStudios” organization; and
  (2) have names beginning with “AstroBox” or “AstroBox-NG”;

unless such materials explicitly declare a different license.

All such works are collectively referred to as the “AstroBox-NG Project
Family.”

This License is intended for software and related materials that are
made available in source form to the community while reserving commercial
rights and binary distribution rights exclusively to the Licensor.

The goals of this License are:

- to allow others to read and study the source code;
- to allow modifications under non-commercial conditions;
- to require that source-level modifications be published under this
  same License when made available to others;
- to strictly prohibit commercial use without explicit written
  permission from the Licensor;
- to permit redistribution of source code under this same License; and
- to restrict redistribution of binaries or executable forms.

All rights not expressly granted are reserved by the Licensor.

     unless such work explicitly states a different license.

     by the Licensor, including all files in a covered repository,

     permissions granted by this License.

1.6. “Original Work” means the Software as provided by the Licensor,
     without Modifications made by You.

     limited to additions, deletions, or alterations to the source code,
     files, structure, or design of the Software.

1.8. “Modified Work” means any work that results from applying one or
     more Modifications to the Software.

     products or services.

1.10. “Plugin” means a separate and independent work that interacts with
      the Software solely through documented public interfaces (such as
      APIs, network protocols, or plugin hooks) and which contains no
      substantial portion of the Software’s source code.


2. Scope of Granted Rights

The rights granted under this License apply to the Software and to all
other works within the AstroBox-NG Project Family.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, the Licensor grants
You a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to:

2.1. obtain, read, study, and privately use the Software’s source code;

2.2. use the Software solely for Non-Commercial Use;

2.3. create Modifications or Modified Works for Non-Commercial Use;

2.4. redistribute the source code of the Original Work and/or Modified
     Works under the terms of Section 5 of this License.


3. Non-Commercial Use Requirement

3.1. You may not use the Software or any Modified Work for any
     commercial purpose without explicit prior written permission from
     the Licensor.

3.2. “Commercial purpose” includes, but is not limited to:
     (a) offering paid products or services incorporating the Software;
     (b) selling access to systems powered by the Software;
     (c) using the Software internally within a for-profit entity where
         it provides operational benefit;
     (d) distributing devices, services, or systems in which the
         Software or a Modified Work is integrated.

3.3. If You are unsure whether a use is commercial, You must seek
     written clarification from the Licensor before proceeding.


4. Modifications and Required Source Availability

4.1. You may create Modifications and Modified Works for
     Non-Commercial Use.

4.2. If You deploy, operate, publish, or otherwise make a Modified Work
     available for others to use (including network access, shared
     environments, or organizational use), You must:

     (a) clearly identify the work as a Modified Work, including a
         description of what was modified and the date of modification;

     (b) make the complete source code of Your Modifications available
         to those users, under this same License, without charge;

     (c) ensure that any Modified Work as a whole remains licensed under
         this License.

4.3. You may distribute only Your own Modifications (e.g., as separate
     files or as a patch) instead of distributing the entire Modified
     Work, provided You do not distribute Original Work source code in
     violation of Section 5.

4.4. You may not impose additional restrictions or terms that conflict
     with this License.


5. Redistribution of Source Code and Restrictions on Binaries

5.1. You may redistribute the source code of the Original Work and/or
     Modified Works, provided that:

     (a) the redistribution is itself for Non-Commercial Use;
     (b) You do not remove or alter existing copyright notices;
     (c) You distribute a copy of this License with the source code;
     (d) any Modified Work remains licensed as a whole under this
         License.

5.2. You may not charge any licensing fee or royalty for redistribution
     under this License. You may charge only a nominal fee that reflects
     actual costs for physical media, bandwidth, or hosting.

5.3. Except with explicit written permission from the Licensor, You may
     NOT redistribute, publish, or convey:

     (a) binaries, executables, installable packages, or compiled forms
         of the Software or any Modified Work;

     (b) any system, product, or device that includes such binaries or
         executables.

5.4. Private backups of the Software under Your exclusive control are
     permitted, provided they are not conveyed to third parties.


6. Plugins and Separate Works

6.1. A Plugin is not considered a Modified Work solely because it
     interacts with the Software.

6.2. Plugins are NOT governed by this License and may use any license
     chosen by the Plugin’s author, provided that:

     (a) the Plugin does not contain substantial portions of the
         Software’s source code; and

     (b) the Plugin does not circumvent or attempt to circumvent the
         restrictions of this License.

6.3. Using the Software together with a Plugin or through network-based
     protocols does not cause the Plugin to fall under this License.


7. Termination

7.1. Any violation of this License automatically and immediately
     terminates all rights granted to You.

7.2. Upon termination, You must cease all use of the Software and
     Modified Works and destroy all copies in Your possession or
     control, except as required by law.

7.3. Rights granted to others directly by the Licensor remain unaffected
     by Your termination.


8. No Warranty

8.1. The Software is provided “AS IS,” without warranty of any kind,
     express or implied.

8.2. The Licensor is under no obligation to provide maintenance,
     updates, patches, support, or continued availability.

8.3. You assume all risks associated with using the Software or any
     Modified Work.

9.1. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Licensor shall not be
     liable for any damages, including direct, indirect, incidental,
     special, exemplary, or consequential damages.

9.2. Where such limitations cannot be fully applied, liability shall be
     limited to the minimum extent permitted by law.


10. Reservation of Rights

10.1. All rights not granted to You under this License are reserved by
      the Licensor.

10.2. This License does not grant You any trademark, service mark,
      trade name, or patent rights.

10.3. The Licensor may offer alternative or commercial licenses on
      different terms. Such offers do not modify this License.

10.4. Any repository under the AstralSightStudios organization whose name
      begins with “AstroBox” or “AstroBox-NG” shall be presumed to be
      governed by this License unless it explicitly declares otherwise.
